    "The cold is stinging your face. Your mouth is open in a silent cry, your hands are full of soft snow, and tears stick the snow to your face.\n\n"
    "The Black Chapel knows why you are here.\n\n"
    "It knows what you have done.\n\n"
    "You remember what you have done.\n\n"
    "It was an accident.\n\n"
    "You tell yourself that to make yourself feel better. You needed your nicotine fix, but you weren't allowed to smoke. You promised yourself you'd stop"
    " smoking. It was too dangerous to light one up, yet you did anyway.\n\n"
    "Important papers, family pictures, sentimental and valuable items all burned down that day. All because you didn't realize the heat from the cigarette"
    " wasn't fully out. You stomped on it and everything. That usually does the trick.\n\n"
    "Usually.\n\n"
    "You thought it was safe to discard it in the trashcan and hide it there rather than outside in the grass.\n\n"
    "But there were added screams and the stench of melting flesh. Screams for help, for either parent, for anything. There were kids — your kids — still in"
    " that house. Your significant other was still in there.\n\n"
    "The roof was the first to cave in. One of the shelves tipped over and collapsed on your partner, pinning them down to the ground with the flames on the"
    " shelf ripping their flesh.\n\n"
    "You remember how their flesh boiled and charred from the heat, sticking and melding with the carpet.\n\n"
    "You remember the sound they made as they tried to reach out for the kids, and their desperate attempts and gurgles they made to reach for their children.\n\n"
    "You couldn't make out the words they were saying as the pain from the flames made them cry out in between whatever noises they attempted to coherently say.\n\n"
    "You tried to help.\n\n"
    "You had already burned your hand on one of the doorknobs to the kids' room. You went to find something to safely open the door, but by the time you came back,"
    " the whole door was on fire. There wasn't any way you could break the door down without hurting your kids on the other side or yourself, so you just stood there"
    " while choking on the ash.\n\n"
    "You could hear the kids cry on the other side.\n\n"
    "You didn't even say anything to them.\n\n"
    "Maybe you were a coward for not trying. You were still with them, but you said nothing.\n\n"
    "You couldn't say anything.\n\n"
    "There was nowhere for you to go, so you just sat on your knees on the other side of the door, cradling your head in your hands as you bore with the searing heat"
    " from the flames.\n\n"
    "You remember crying with them as you continued to hear their raw screams, pleading for you to help them. They probably weren't even coughing from the smoke of the"
    " flames.\n\n"
    "As the flames burned hotter and hotter, they continued to cry out for someone to help them. One of them threw up from crying and yelling so much.\n\n"
    "You wanted to tell them to stop talking, to stop pleading and save their breath for when someone could actually help them.\n\n"
    "But you knew there was no one to help them. If you couldn't, who else could?\n\n"
    "The crying stopped when the floor lost its structural weight, bringing you down to the bottom floor.\n\n"
    "That's all you remembered feeling at that final moment.\n\n"
    "The last thing you heard was screaming.\n\n"
    "Someone cradles your head and brings it onto something soft.\n\n"
    "You can't open your eyes as they are frozen shut by your tears and the snow. Soft touches brush the remaining debris off your face, and you want to open your"
    " eyes, but you can't.\n\n"
    "You can't look.\n\n"
    "\tHER: Have you sought your guidance?\n\n"
    "You want to move and cling to Her for comfort, but you can't tell if any of your body parts are moving.\n\n"
    "The cold has made your body so numb.\n\n"
    "\tYOU: Yes.\n\n"
    "You croak your response, your voice barely a whisper above the icy wind.\n\n"
    "You press your lips together, feeling the warmth emanate slowly. Your eyes feel warm from the overflow of tears. There's probably snot running down your nose"
    " and coating your lips.\n\n"
    "You don't know why you hesitate to say something more, but you revel in the grace She has given you.\n\n"
    "Now you understand why people devote their lives to a single person. You don't mind devoting your life to Her, but now remembering that you already have lived,"
    " you almost sob at the thought of being unable to properly pray to Her.\n\n"
    "What would you even pray for?\n\n"
    "\tYOU: Thank you…\n\n"
    "That's all you can manage to say.\n\n"
    "She doesn't say anything. You feel like She's looking down at you with pity, and you simply cling onto Her for all you can.\n\n"
    "\tHER: Your time has come. Perhaps you can see your family another day.\n\n"
    "You think back to the Red Chapel and almost laugh.\n\n"
    "You won't be seeing your family again at all.\n\n"
    "Not after what you've done.\n\n"
    "You won't be able to reach their level."
